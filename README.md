# About Us
K4sper Entertainment is a game development team made by Vlad. The Story is very short and nothing very complicated. Since I(Vlad) was 11 years old I have had a very big passion for programming and computers. I started playing a lot of games and started wondering how they work behind all of these characters, weapons, bosses, and so on. I started to research and make small creations, I've started working with Source Engine, modding the popular game from that time here Counter-Strike 1.6. I started modding a lot of things like weapons custom config files that some of them were with some cheats in them. I've made a custom website with a free website builder and started to sell custom models, configs, and hacks hard, all of these weren't made by me but they were very hard to obtain and only from a lot of underground Russian forums often full of malware and viruses but surprisingly I've never infected my pc :). Then I started system administration in Linux and Windows server OS, business management, and other stuff but the time went by and when I was about 12 or 13 years old, I've started working in unreal engine, I wanted so hard to have a proper game but I understood that wasn't possible at that time without a team, assets, voice actors, etc and I remained a proud member of modding community for a lot of games and a constant developer of some open source projects have the ability then to start working a lot of languages and started windows app development with c#. One day I've met a guy from the UK that was a sound artist that was making a lot of cool and nice soundtracks, then I have a project in development in Brooklyn using unreal engine 4, we started to be very good friends. Then I gather a couple of friends that were interested in this domain, I've picked a name of the team, all of us were happy to be part of this, and this is the story of K4sper Entertainment.
